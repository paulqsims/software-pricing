## Problem Statement

Company X performed an AB test on two pricing variants for a software to understand which one results in more conversions. Data were collected throughout the US and customers either saw a $39 price or a $59 price variant. 

## Objectives

1. Determine which, if any, pricing variant resulted in a higher conversion rate
2. Evaluate what features best predict conversion
3. Segment customer base for future targeting 


## Approach

1. Run a hypothesis test to statistically compare differences in conversion rates between two price variants
2. Build a predictive model of conversion probability
3. TBD.

## Preliminary results

1. The AB test results estimate a 28% conversion lift in the \\$39 group compared to the $59 group
